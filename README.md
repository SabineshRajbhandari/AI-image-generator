Example: https://your‑username.github.io/AI-image-generator

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The user enters a prompt or selects options via the UI  
2. JavaScript handles the request to an AI image generation API / model  
3. The backend or third‑party service returns image data  
4. The UI displays the generated image  

*(You can expand or replace steps depending on your implementation.)*

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

- Performance may vary depending on the AI service  
- No error handling for network failures (to be added)  
- Currently front-end only — no server-side logic  
- Limited to small image sizes
